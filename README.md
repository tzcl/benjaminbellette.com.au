Compared to an earlier version of this site that was built using JQuery, this version is much more performant - it reduces Time to Interactive by a factor of 10 and cuts Total Blocking Time in half. The difference is due to optimising images, deferring the loading of resources (thanks to Astro's islands architecture), and decreasing the JavaScript bundle size.
